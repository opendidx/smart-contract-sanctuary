ERC-X is an Ethereum standard written by Github user jasperdg.
ERC-X is a protocol which allows users to mint ERC-721 tokens that also have a ERC-20 token attatched to them.
This allows a user to create a non-fungible assets on the Ethereum chain that are devidable and 
distributable. This could be used for the tokenization of secureties like companies (shares) and real-estate.
